# can right more complex code to solve higher complexity problems
# easier to debugg than a long extensive set of code
# easier to read and group functions

=begin
	- allows more abstract thinking
	- easier to conceptualize
	- restrict and expose functionality to parts of code that only need it
	- give functionality to different parts of an application without dupication
	- build applications faster by reusing code
	- easier to manage complex software
